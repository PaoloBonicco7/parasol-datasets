# PARASOL Project Datasets

Welcome to the repository containing the datasets created as part of the PARASOL project. Our project focuses on utilizing advanced AI models to enhance legal document analysis, providing insights into how these models can be leveraged in the field of law.

## Dataset Overview

The initial dataset features a CSV file containing the results of various prompting techniques tested on OpenAI's ChatGPT models (versions 3.5 and 4). These techniques include:

- Zero-shot prompting
- Zero-shot with chain of thought prompting
- Few-shot prompting
- Few-shot prompting on a portion of documents

The data originates from the "Termini e Condizioni" sections of significant Italian websites, reflecting the nuances of Italian law. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for understanding how different prompting techniques influence model performance, specifically in legal contexts.

## Purpose of the Dataset

The primary goal of this dataset is to offer a preliminary understanding of how AI models, particularly ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, can be applied to improve workflows in legal environments. It explores how various prompting techniques can enhance the models' effectiveness, providing a stepping stone for developing best practices in AI-assisted legal document analysis.

By analyzing and utilizing this dataset, researchers and legal professionals can gain insights into the potential of AI to streamline and augment their work, paving the way for more sophisticated applications in the future.

## How to Use the Dataset

This dataset is intended for researchers, data scientists, and legal professionals interested in AI's role in law. It can be used to:

- Compare the effectiveness of different prompting techniques in processing legal documents.
- Develop strategies for integrating AI into legal research and document analysis.
- Explore the potential of AI to provide insights into legal terminology and concepts based on Italian law.

We encourage you to delve into the dataset and explore the possibilities it unveils for the intersection of AI and law.
